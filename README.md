#Cube Sorter
A tool to sort MTG set cubes into packs that will help to create a more retail pack like environment

The reason I built this project is that I have a Magic the Gathering "cube" that I would like to get out now and then and use, but it requires some set up beforehad.

If you're unfamiliar with the terminology, a "cube" is a collection of cards from collectible card games that you use to be able to repeatedly limited formats. This may be "drafting" which involves passing around packs of cards around a table and you choosing one before passing it to your right or left, or "sealed" which involves you receiving a pool of 6 packs of 15 cards and building your deck from that. Most cubes are singleton, which means that it has one of each card, but this one is different in that it looks to emulate the environment of playing this format specificially.

The problem that I ran into is that if I wanted to use my Innistrad cube it would require some amount of set up to best try to recreate an environment that would be like a retail experience, where you open sealed packs of cards. I wrote this script with the intention of being able to randomize my own packs while eventually being able to more replicate a more retail pack-like environment, such as there being no risk of duplicate cards in the pack.

As of right now it's a simple JavaScript file that reads from the ISD.json file from MTGJSON.com, but it could potentially be used for other sets in the future with minimal tweeking.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
